# Lung-Cancer-Insight-Comprehensive-Study-using-SQL

This project aims to comprehensively analyze the Lung Cancer Data Set, highlighting the significant impact of smoking on health, leading to lung cancer. By examining data trends, we'll uncover how smoking relates to lung cancer across different age groups and pinpoint the age group with the highest smoking rates. Through visualization, we'll illuminate the connections between smoking behaviors and their health outcomes, providing insights into the varying effects on different age groups:
